      <h3> Research on the "Comparison of Job Search Engines and Specialized Job Boards Based on Information Quality of Employment Opportunities"</h3>
     <img class="portfolio" src="assets/project1.png" alt="bar graph from research project">
     <p>
       This is my most recent project which included me looking at different job search engines and specialized job boards to find which one had the better quality of information. A website evaluation criteria was used to conduct this research. The research was part of work done for the Discovery magnet program at my school. I created a research paper and presented this topic in a few Science Fairs.

     <p>
       I participated in the National History Day Competition with this project that looked at the triumph and tragedy associated with the Berlin Blockade and Airlift. I created a website to present these ideas. The website <a href="http://70333339.nhd.weebly.com/end-of-blockade.html">"Berlin Blockade and Airlift"</a> that I created is linked.
